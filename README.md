# HealthCare Analysis with Python

# üè• No-Show Appointments Analysis (Healthcare Data)

## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes a real-world healthcare dataset of over 100,000 medical appointments to understand patient behavior and identify factors that influence **no-shows**. Using Python, the analysis focuses on how variables like age, gender, medical conditions, and scheduling affect whether a patient attends their appointment.

## üßæ Dataset Description

Each row in the dataset represents a medical appointment with the following columns:

| Column           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `patientid`      | Unique identifier for a patient |
| `appointmentid`  | Unique identifier for an appointment |
| `gender`         | Male or Female |
| `scheduledday`   | Date the appointment was scheduled |
| `appointmentday` | Actual appointment date |
| `age`            | Patient's age |
| `neighbourhood`  | Location of the clinic |
| `scholarship`    | 1 if the patient is enrolled in a welfare program |
| `hipertension`   | 1 if the patient has hypertension |
| `diabetes`       | 1 if the patient has diabetes |
| `alcoholism`     | 1 if the patient has a history of alcoholism |
| `handcap`        | Disability count (0‚Äì4) |
| `sms_received`   | 1 if the patient received a reminder SMS |
| `no_show`        | 'Yes' if the patient missed the appointment |
| `sch_weekday`    | Day of the week the appointment was scheduled |

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Converted date columns to datetime format
- Standardized column names and values (e.g., fixed typos like "hipertension")
- Removed rows with invalid ages (e.g., negative values)
- Created new features such as waiting time between scheduled and appointment dates

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Questions Explored:

1. **What percentage of patients miss their appointments?**
   - ~20% of all scheduled patients do not show up.

2. **Does age affect attendance?**
   - Younger patients, especially under 25, are more likely to miss appointments.

3. **Does receiving an SMS reminder help?**
   - Slight improvement in show rates was observed for patients who received SMS.

4. **Are certain neighborhoods more prone to no-shows?**
   - High no-show rates were found in specific neighborhoods with low income levels.

5. **Do chronic conditions affect attendance?**
   - Patients with hypertension or diabetes tend to attend more consistently.

## üìà Visualizations

- Barplot for age, gender, sms received and disease indicators
- Barh chart for neigborhoods
- Histogram for age and waiting time
- Heatmap for correlation matrix

## ‚úÖ Conclusion and Recommendations
  ‚úÖ 1. Send Targeted SMS Reminders to High-Risk Patients
Insight: Patients who didn‚Äôt receive SMS reminders had a higher no-show rate.
Recommendation:
Implement automated SMS reminders, especially for:
   i. Patients under age 25 (who showed higher no-show rates)
   ii. Appointments with longer waiting times (e.g., scheduled 10+ days ahead)

   ‚úÖ 2. Reduce Waiting Time Between Scheduling and Appointment
Insight: Longer waiting times were correlated with higher no-show likelihood.
Recommendation:
Aim to shorten the gap between scheduledday and appointmentday


‚úÖ 3. Optimize Scheduling Based on No-Show Trends by Weekday
Insight: Certain weekdays (e.g., Fridays or Mondays, based on your plot) showed higher no-show rates.
Recommendation:
   i. Avoid scheduling first-time or high-risk patients on historically high no-show days

   ‚úÖ 4. Educate Patients on Chronic Condition Follow-ups
Insight: Patients with hypertension and diabetes were more likely to attend their appointments.
Recommendation:
  i. Use this finding to educate and motivate other patients about the importance of regular visits
ii. For patients without chronic conditions, send educational SMS or email campaigns on preventive care
